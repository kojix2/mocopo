# Requirements Definition

## Overview
This project aims to create a Crystal language library named "MocoPo" for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The library will enable developers to easily implement MCP servers that interact with language models like Claude and Gemini, allowing control over various software and devices.

## Target Users
- Developers who want to build MCP servers using Crystal.
- Users interested in integrating language models with external tools and resources.

## Core Features
- Full implementation of MCP protocol primitives: Tools, Resources, and Prompts.
- APIs for registering and executing tools.
- APIs for managing and retrieving resources.
- Support for prompt management (planned for future versions).
- DSL-style API design integrated with Kemal for ease of use.
- High performance and lightweight server leveraging Crystal's capabilities.

## Extensibility
- Designed to accommodate future protocol extensions.
- Easy addition of custom tools and resources by users.

## Dependencies
- Kemal as the primary web framework.
- Minimal additional dependencies to keep the library lightweight.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Maintainable and well-documented codebase.
- Comprehensive test coverage using Crystal's Spec framework.
- Clear and concise documentation generated with Crystal's doc tools.
