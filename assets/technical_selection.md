# Technical Selection

## Web Framework
- Use Kemal for HTTP server implementation due to its lightweight nature and Crystal optimization.
- Consider Crystal's HTTP::Server for lower-level control if needed in the future.

## JSON Handling
- Utilize Crystal's standard JSON module (`JSON::Any`) for parsing and generating JSON.
- Evaluate alternative JSON libraries if performance or type safety requirements arise.

## DSL Design
- Provide a block-based DSL for registering tools and resources.
- Leverage Crystal's macros and blocks for intuitive and type-safe API.

## Testing Framework
- Use Crystal's built-in Spec framework for unit and integration tests.
- Integrate with CI pipelines for continuous testing.

## Documentation
- Generate API documentation using Crystal's `crystal doc`.
- Maintain clear README and usage examples.

## Other Considerations
- Keep dependencies minimal to reduce maintenance overhead.
- Design for scalability and future protocol enhancements.
